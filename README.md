## 📖 About

The **Azeroth Legacy Launcher** is a powerful, open-source universal launcher designed to modernize your experience across multiple expansions. Whether you play on **1.12.1**, **2.4.3 / 2.5.2**, or **3.3.5a**, this launcher provides unparalleled security, automated game management, and a seamless addon ecosystem.

It is the first private server launcher to feature **Advanced Integrity Verification**, ensuring that your client code is authentic, safe, and unmodified.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🛡️ Security & Integrity (New in v3.0)
*   **ASAR Code Verification**: Unlike standard launchers that only check the `.exe`, we verify the cryptographic hash of the internal `app.asar` code archive.
*   **Real-Time Dashboard**: A dedicated security status card in the "About" section provides instant feedback (Secure/Warning/Danger).
*   **Active Threat Monitoring**: Immediate visual alerts on the sidebar if any integrity mismatch is detected.

### 🧩 Next-Gen Addon Manager
*   **Universal Browser**: Browse and install addons directly from the Warperia database.
*   **One-Click Install**: No more unzipping or manual folder management. Just click "Install".
*   **Smart Grouping**: Automatically groups multi-module addons into single, clean entries.
*   **Local Management**: Easily update or delete your existing addons.

### 🎨 Immersive Experience
*   **Integrated Music Player**: Enjoy the iconic soundtracks while you browse.
*   **Classic Layout**: A refined user interface that pays homage to the original game launcher while using modern glass-morphism effects.

### ⚡ Smart Game Management
*   **Multi-Version Support**: Built-in support for managing **1.12.1**, **2.4.3**, **2.5.2**, and **3.3.5a** clients.
*   **Auto-Locate**: Intelligently finds and verifies existing game installations for any supported version.
